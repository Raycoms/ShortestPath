# ShortestPath
Improved parallel shortest path calculation.

Rewrote an existing algorithm in C++ which had as purpose to find the k shortest paths.
Following the algorithm of Yens top k shortest paths algorithm.

Rewriting included addition of parallelism and acceptance of bigger graphs.

The proposed algorithm is a lot faster than existing algorithms in C++ for bigger graphs since he doesn't rely on a completely cached and preprocesed gaphs.

Implementation was written to be fast and comprehensible.
